# Book Mapper Application - Hashtable
- The application allows users to search through a collection of books stored in the CSV format.
- Users can look up a book directly through its ISBN number. 
- The application can check whether the ISBN is well formed and warn the user if this is not the case. 
- The application is based on a hash table that maps ISBN numbers to books. 
- To allow searching through titles and authors, the hash table also supports iterating through all the books in the table.
